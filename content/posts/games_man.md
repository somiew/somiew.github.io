I’ve been playing a lot of games lately. Or… A lot of games for the very limited amount of spare time I have at hands. It’s been loads for fun though. More fun than I have had gaming in a long long time.
I quite recently bought a new graphics card, and I guess I have to attribute my newfound joy to this, as I’ve not been able to enjoy AAA titles to their extent in recent years.
Don’t get me wrong, many smaller game studios make incredible games as well, but it’s something special to get a full experience of a game that was made of hundreds of people over several years. At least if it’s done well. And let me tell you about a game that does it REALLY well! [Forza Horizon 5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forza_Horizon_5) Holy hell is it a well made game. Big open world. Lots of stuff to unlock. Many corners to dig deep into.

* Costumize your car!
* Wait! Don’t just customize it, make custom car paints and earn in game currency by getting others to download your custom paints.
* Tune your car before a race!
* Wait! Don’t just tune your car, experiment with tunings and make them available for everyone!
* Race online! Create your own races and challenge others!
* Set your own goals:
    * Buy all the real estate you can
    * Buy every car of a certain brand
    * Try to speed the fastest you can at every speed trap
    * Take extraordinary photos, share them with other players
    * Buy and sell cars at the auction house
* Or you know, just play the story and explore the world.

Fan-fucking-tastic!
