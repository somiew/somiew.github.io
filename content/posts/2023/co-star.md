Today I learned about Co-Star, and therefore, so will you!  
It's an astrology app, and just like many others like it, it gives the user a daily horoscope. But this one is special, because this one is "based on science". It uses data fromÂ [NASA JPL](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/)Â and the "magic of dates and AI", to find patterns and create horoscopes. Created by Banu Guler, a woman who, ackording to Wikipedia, once brought an astrological chart to a baby shower, where she noticed it was such a hit, she decided to create an app for it. ðŸ¤·. Wild stuff. She does however have a killerÂ [website](https://banuguler.com/), so go check that one out!
