A week or two ago I started playing a game I've been thinking about playing ever since the sequel was announced, over 20 years after the first game. Pokémon Snap. Admittedly I first thought about buying the new game, 'New Pokémon Snap'. But it felt a bit expensive for a rail shooter in 2021, especially since its coming from a game company that doesn't really care. So I thought I'd wait for a while, see if the price dropped. Not very long after however, Nintendo announced that the original Pokémon Snap would come to Nintendo Online. So my plan changed, and I was to try the original first, and if I liked it, I would consider buying the new one.

4 hours in, I'm now on level 5/7 and I've really enjoyed my journey so far. It's a cosy game to play handheld, when ones partner wants to watch something on the telly but you're not that interested but still wanna sit beside in the couch, not needing to really have full focus on either.

I still struggle to persuade myself into buying the new one though. 600 kr seem a bit steep for an 11 hour long rail shooter, but if there ever is a sale or I manage to find it used, I'll probably get it. Heck, it might even be worth it to use a [Nintendo Switch Voucher](https://www.nintendo.com/whatsnew/nintendo-switch-online-member-exclusive-save-on-two-digital-games/) for it some time in the future.

My most point awarding shot so far.  
Even though it's very far away, it's still a Flying Pikachu.
