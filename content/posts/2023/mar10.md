March 10, a.k.a. MAR10 day. First celebrated by Nintendo 2016, 
probably when some clever Nintendian came up with the idea. 
And since then, they’ve actually made something each year to celebrate Mario, 
even if some years have been lazier than others. 
This year we got the [final trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdD9geN6erk) for 
The Super Mario Bros. Movie, [Wave 4](https://www.nintendo.com/whatsnew/wave-4-is-out-now-for-the-mario-kart-8-deluxe-booster-course-pass-dlc/) of the Mario Kart 8 Deluxe – 
Booster Course Pass (car stuff, pretty fitting since it’s also the [V8 engines day](https://www.scania.com/group/en/home/newsroom/news/2020/international-v8-day-old-meets-new.html) today) and a new 
Mario themed [Nintendo Switch bundle](https://www.nintendo.com/store/products/nintendo-switch-mario-choose-one-bundle-118107/). And lots of smaller stuff as well. 
Like whatever [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4nq-JDPDgA) is.
I must admit though, I am pretty hyped for the movie, so another trailer is always welcome!

**Off topic:** I’ve been to the local Arken Zoo today, to get Eden a fur-cut. Fun to imagine it working the same way on people. A hairdresser trying to cut the hair of a customer who really doesn’t want to be there and tries to escape as soon as there’s a chance.
