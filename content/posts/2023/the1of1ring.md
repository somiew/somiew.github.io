A couple days ago Wizards of the Coast revealed some cards for the new Lord of the Rings crossover set. One of which was "The One Ring". "The One Ring", is going to have a special _special_ edition - extended art with text in elvish (Quenya in Tengwar letterform to be exact, if that tells you anything you're a huge NERD). This card, among some others, will be what they call serialized. Numbered card, that show exactly which card you got, from a limited print run.

- Serialized Elven Sol Ring: 300 prints

- Serialized Dwarven Sol Ring: 700 prints

- Serialized Human Sol Ring: 900 prints

- Serielized The One Ring: 1 print

Yes, you read that right, they're printing **ONE** copy of that card. The amount of parables already made to Charlie and the Chocolate factory are many. But even Willy Wonka himself made sure 5 golden tickets were printed. How big are the odds that this card never sees daylight? No one knows. Unless WotC tracks this card, which wouldn't be unheard of. But also a bit of cheating from their end. Rumours say that there will be about 3,000,000 boosters, so chances of drawing The 1 of 1 Ring are pretty slim. You are more likely to get hit by lightning. Oh and I haven't even mentioned the best part yet. It will be in one of the collector boosters, which seem to start at around 450 SEK per booster or around [4999 SEK](https://alphaspel.se/1982-boosters-displayer-och-bundles/189384-magic-the-gathering-the-lord-of-the-rings-tales-of-middle-earth-collector-booster-display-12) for a display of 12 boosters.  
  
Looks good though!
