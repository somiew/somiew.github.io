      <title>Old PokÃ©mon Snap</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A week or two ago I started playing a game I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about playing ever since the sequel was announced, over 20 years after the first game. PokÃ©mon Snap. Admittedly I first thought about buying the new game, &amp;lsquo;New PokÃ©mon Snap&amp;rsquo;. But it felt a bit expensive for a rail shooter in 2021, especially since its coming from a game company that doesn&amp;rsquo;t really care. So I thought I&amp;rsquo;d wait for a while, see if the price dropped. Not very long after however, Nintendo announced that the original PokÃ©mon Snap would come to Nintendo Online. So my plan changed, and I was to try the original first, and if I liked it, I would consider buying the new one.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Tony Hawk&#39;sâ„¢ Pro Skaterâ„¢ 1 &#43; 2</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A while ago I beat THPS 1+2 for the fifth time and it&amp;rsquo;s still as good of a game as the first time. I never played the originals when they released, but I did play a lot of Tony Hawk as a kid. THPS 3 was the first in the series I played, a cousin lent it to me after I had gotten hold of a used PlayStation 2. It was a great game, but I had heard that there were better Tony Hawk games. Underground 1 and 2, where it was possible to throw tomatoes, ride a bull and spray your own tag across the city. But most importantly, you didn&amp;rsquo;t need to ride ALL the time. If you wanted to aim for a specific jump or go for a certain rail, it was possible to get off the board and walk there. Eventually I got to play these games as well, at friends places and sometimes I even got to borrow them for short periods of time, but my first ever own Tony Hawk&amp;rsquo;s, was American Wasteland.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The White Avicii Nintendo Switch Lite</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Nintendo has done a lot of custom coloured Switches, especially of the standard Switch. The &amp;rsquo;lite&amp;rsquo; version though, mostly has some basic recolours. And a couple of PokÃ©mon variants. But there is one Switch Lite that stands out of the crew. The white, custom gold painted Avicii Invector Switch Lite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2017 &lt;a href=&#34;https://hellotheregames.com/&#34;&gt;Hello There Games&lt;/a&gt; released &amp;lsquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oWAqf5ckvU&#34;&gt;Invector&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo; on the PS4. A rhythm based music game with 22 of Aviciis hit songs. In 2019, the year after his tragic passing, they released an updated version with 35 songs, in collaboration with the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.timberglingfoundation.org/&#34;&gt;Tim Bergling Foundation&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nintendo.com/store/products/avicii-invector-encore-edition-switch/&#34;&gt;Avicii Invector: Encore Edition&lt;/a&gt;, and with the release, there was a charity auction, where all the money gathered went to the mental health organisation, &lt;a href=&#34;https://safeinourworld.org/&#34;&gt;Safe In Our World&lt;/a&gt;. This is where the rare Switch Lite enters the stage. Five beautiful custom painted switches were auctioned out. And what makes them extra special is that they&amp;rsquo;re actually licensed by Nintendo. Many companies has had lotteries or the like with custom painted or shells swapped switches, but this is actually a fully legit licensed Nintendo Switch Lite, and it. Is. Beautiful!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The 1 of 1 Ring</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A couple days ago Wizards of the Coast revealed some cards for the new Lord of the Rings crossover set. One of which was &amp;ldquo;The One Ring&amp;rdquo;. &amp;ldquo;The One Ring&amp;rdquo;, is going to have a specialÂ &lt;em&gt;special&lt;/em&gt;Â edition - extended art with text in elvish (Quenya in Tengwar letterform to be exact, if that tells you anything you&amp;rsquo;re a huge NERD). This card, among some others, will be what they call serialized. Numbered card, that show exactly which card you got, from a limited print run.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Co - Star</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today I learned about Co-Star, and therefore, so will you!&lt;br&gt;
It&amp;rsquo;s an astrology app, and just like many others like it, it gives the user a daily horoscope. But this one is special, because this one is &amp;ldquo;based on science&amp;rdquo;. It uses data fromÂ &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/&#34;&gt;NASA JPL&lt;/a&gt;Â and the &amp;ldquo;magic of dates and AI&amp;rdquo;, to find patterns and create horoscopes. Created by Banu Guler, a woman who, ackording to Wikipedia, once brought an astrological chart to a baby shower, where she noticed it was such a hit, she decided to create an app for it. ðŸ¤·. Wild stuff. She does however have a killerÂ &lt;a href=&#34;https://banuguler.com/&#34;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;, so go check that one out!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;March 10, a.k.a. MAR10 day. First celebrated by Nintendo 2016,
probably when some clever Nintendian came up with the idea.
And since then, theyâ€™ve actually made something each year to celebrate Mario,
even if some years have been lazier than others.
This year we got the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdD9geN6erk&#34;&gt;final trailer&lt;/a&gt; for
The Super Mario Bros. Movie, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nintendo.com/whatsnew/wave-4-is-out-now-for-the-mario-kart-8-deluxe-booster-course-pass-dlc/&#34;&gt;Wave 4&lt;/a&gt; of the Mario Kart 8 Deluxe â€“
Booster Course Pass (car stuff, pretty fitting since itâ€™s also the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.scania.com/group/en/home/newsroom/news/2020/international-v8-day-old-meets-new.html&#34;&gt;V8 engines day&lt;/a&gt; today) and a new
Mario themed &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nintendo.com/store/products/nintendo-switch-mario-choose-one-bundle-118107/&#34;&gt;Nintendo Switch bundle&lt;/a&gt;. And lots of smaller stuff as well.
Like whatever &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4nq-JDPDgA&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; is.
I must admit though, I am pretty hyped for the movie, so another trailer is always welcome!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Games man</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Iâ€™ve been playing a lot of games lately. Orâ€¦ A lot of games for the very limited amount of spare time I have at hands. Itâ€™s been loads for fun though. More fun than I have had gaming in a long long time.
I quite recently bought a new graphics card, and I guess I have to attribute my newfound joy to this, as Iâ€™ve not been able to enjoy AAA titles to their extent in recent years.
Donâ€™t get me wrong, many smaller game studios make incredible games as well, but itâ€™s something special to get a full experience of a game that was made of hundreds of people over several years. At least if itâ€™s done well. And let me tell you about a game that does it REALLY well! &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forza_Horizon_5&#34;&gt;Forza Horizon 5&lt;/a&gt; Holy hell is it a well made game. Big open world. Lots of stuff to unlock. Many corners to dig deep into.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is my very own little nook on the internet, where I try out new things, show off what I like and generally just do whatever I want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now itâ€™s a bit under construction, and in a way I think it always will be. Hopyfully this page will always keep growing with new side projects popping up here and there.ðŸ¤ž
