      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve been playing a lot of games lately. Or… A lot of games for the very limited amount of spare time I have at hands. It’s been loads for fun though. More fun than I have had gaming in a long long time.
I quite recently bought a new graphics card, and I guess I have to attribute my newfound joy to this, as I’ve not been able to enjoy AAA titles to their extent in recent years.
Don’t get me wrong, many smaller game studios make incredible games as well, but it’s something special to get a full experience of a game that was made of hundreds of people over several years. At least if it’s done well. And let me tell you about a game that does it REALLY well! &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forza_Horizon_5&#34;&gt;Forza Horizon 5&lt;/a&gt; Holy hell is it a well made game. Big open world. Lots of stuff to unlock. Many corners to dig deep into.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
