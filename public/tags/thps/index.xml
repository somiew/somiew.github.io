      <description>&lt;p&gt;A while ago I beat THPS 1+2 for the fifth time and it&amp;rsquo;s still as good of a game as the first time. I never played the originals when they released, but I did play a lot of Tony Hawk as a kid. THPS 3 was the first in the series I played, a cousin lent it to me after I had gotten hold of a used PlayStation 2. It was a great game, but I had heard that there were better Tony Hawk games. Underground 1 and 2, where it was possible to throw tomatoes, ride a bull and spray your own tag across the city. But most importantly, you didn&amp;rsquo;t need to ride ALL the time. If you wanted to aim for a specific jump or go for a certain rail, it was possible to get off the board and walk there. Eventually I got to play these games as well, at friends places and sometimes I even got to borrow them for short periods of time, but my first ever own Tony Hawk&amp;rsquo;s, was American Wasteland.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
