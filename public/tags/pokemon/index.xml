      <description>&lt;p&gt;A week or two ago I started playing a game I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about playing ever since the sequel was announced, over 20 years after the first game. Pokémon Snap. Admittedly I first thought about buying the new game, &amp;lsquo;New Pokémon Snap&amp;rsquo;. But it felt a bit expensive for a rail shooter in 2021, especially since its coming from a game company that doesn&amp;rsquo;t really care. So I thought I&amp;rsquo;d wait for a while, see if the price dropped. Not very long after however, Nintendo announced that the original Pokémon Snap would come to Nintendo Online. So my plan changed, and I was to try the original first, and if I liked it, I would consider buying the new one.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
